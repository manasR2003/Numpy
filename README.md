numpy.random is used to generate random numbers and probability-based data.

It is faster and more powerful than Python’s built-in random module.

Supports generating multiple random values at once.

np.random.choice() allows random selection with custom probabilities.

Probabilities (p) must sum to 1.

np.random.randint() generates random integers within a range.

np.random.rand() generates float values between 0 and 1.

np.random.randn() generates values from a standard normal distribution.

np.random.uniform() generates values with equal probability.

np.random.normal() generates values based on mean and standard deviation.

np.random.seed() ensures reproducible random results.

Widely used in data science, machine learning, simulations, and testing.
